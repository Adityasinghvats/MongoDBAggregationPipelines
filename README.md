## To practice using following commands simply create a `database` with `<name of your choice>` in MongoDB and add collections named `authors` , `books`, `users`.
- Using MongoDB connection string , connect your database from VS Code using `MongoDB extension`.
- Now you will find the `database` and `collections` which you named in VS Code side panel with MongoDB icon.
- `Right Click` on each collection name and choose `insert document`.
- Change `db.getCollection('authors').insertOne` to `db.getCollection('authors').insertMany`.
- Get all data from [source](https://gist.github.com/hiteshchoudhary/a80d86b50a5d9c591198a23d79e1e467).
- To get data press `Raw` and copy the contents.
- Insert `data.json` into `users` collection.
- Copy and paste the json object within the function and then run using ðŸ”º on top.
- All the documents will now be added to your DB.
- Now within your `database` open `users` , now go to `Aggregation` and select `Text`.
- Start writing your commands till exercise 5 one by one according to the question.
- Exercise 6 or lookup is to be used in `books` -> `Aggregation` -> `Text` .
